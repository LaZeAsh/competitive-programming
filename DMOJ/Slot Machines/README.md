## Thought Process

Confused about this problem, especially by the input, I feel like it would be better if DMOJ had a structure similar to Leetcode where it set the function up for you

### Designated

1 play = 1 quarter
First Machine: 35th play = 35 quarters
Second Machine: 100th play = 60 quarters
Third Machine: 10th play = 9 quarters

### Input

x = # of quarters which will be greater than 1 and less than 1000
y = # of times machine has been played since it last paid
