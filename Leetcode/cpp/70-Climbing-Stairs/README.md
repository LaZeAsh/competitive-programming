# Approach

I already knew this was a Dynamic Programming question based off the label in Blind 75. This kind of ruined some of the fun for me

I used the recursive memoization technique to solve this, basically I defined a base case of how many steps it can go up using when n = 2 or n = 1

I stored such values in a memo vector array

Classic DP problem
