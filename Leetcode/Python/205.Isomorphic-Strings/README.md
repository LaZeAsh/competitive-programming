## Problem

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/

## Solution

if the length of both the strings isn't the same it's instantly wrong

Approach: When iterating through both the strings store the values in a dict and if it's trying to be accessed again 
and the values aren't the same for what's in the dict and what's trying to be added it's instantly not an
isomorphic string

## Issues

43/44 test cases are being passed and I try to use the debugger to see why the last test case is not being passed currently
I have no solution and instead of wasting my time on this I am going to try other problems so the current solution only
passes 43/44 test cases
