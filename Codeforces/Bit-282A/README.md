## Analysis

first input line gives us how many lines there are following that one

- X is given the initial value of 0
- ++ = increase value by 1
- -- = decrease value by 1
- Operation and variable can be written in any order

## Solution

- Use a variable to track the value of X
- Iterate through the input lines
- Ignore the X check only if input has ++ or -- and then increase/decrease value of X accordingly
- Send appropriate value of X out
